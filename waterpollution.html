<p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (e.g. lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater). This form of environmental degradation occurs when pollutants are directly or indirectly discharged into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds.

<li align="justify">Asbestos has cancer-causing properties. When inhaled, it can cause illnesses such as asbestosis and some types of cancer
<li align="justify">Lead and Mercury-These are metallic elements and can cause environmental and health problems for humans and animals. It is also poisonous. It is usually very hard to clean it up from the environment once it gets into it because it is non-biodegradable. 
<li align="justify"><i>Nitrates & Phosphates–</i> These are found in fertilizers, and are often washed from the soils to nearby water bodies. They can cause eutrophication, which can be very problematic to marine environments.
<li align="justify"><i>Oils –</i> Oils form a thick layer on the water surface because they do not dissolve in water. This can stop marine plants receiving enough light for photosynthesis. It is also harmful to fish and marine birds. A classic example is the BP oil spill in 2012 with killed thousands of animal species.

<li align="justify"><i>Death of aquatic (water) animals</i>
The main problem caused by water pollution is that it kills life that depends on these water bodies. Dead fish, crabs, birds and sea gulls , dolphins, and many other animals often wind up on beaches, killed by pollutants in their habitat (living environment)..
<li align="justify"><i>Disruption of food-chains
Pollution disrupts the natural food chain as well. Pollutants such as lead and cadmium are eaten by tiny animals. Later, these animals are consumed by fish and shellfish, and the food chain continues to be disrupted at all higher levels.
d<li align="justify"><i>Diseases
Eventually, humans are affected by this process as well. People can get diseases such as hepatitis by eating seafood that has been poisoned. In many poor nations, there is always outbreak of cholera and diseases as a result of poor drinking water treatment from contaminated waters.
